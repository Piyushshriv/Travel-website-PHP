🌍 Travel Explorer – A Dynamic Travel Website using PHP & MySQL
Welcome to Travel Explorer, a full-featured travel website project built with PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL, powered by XAMPP and managed through phpMyAdmin. This project is ideal for learning full-stack web development and serves as a foundational model for building modern travel booking platforms.

📌 Project Description
Travel Explorer is a dynamic and interactive travel website where users can explore destinations, browse tour packages, and submit inquiries or booking requests. The project uses PHP for server-side logic, HTML/CSS for structure and styling, JavaScript for client-side interactivity, and MySQL for storing data. XAMPP is used as a local server environment to run Apache and MySQL services, while phpMyAdmin is used for easy database management.

The site mimics real-world travel portals with basic features such as displaying travel destinations, collecting contact/booking information, and storing them securely in a database.
