✈️ Travel Bliss – Dynamic Travel Website
Travel Bliss is a dynamic and interactive travel website built using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. This project serves as a full-fledged platform for showcasing travel destinations, managing tour packages, collecting user inquiries, and enabling booking functionality. Designed with a user-first approach and a clean UI, this website offers both aesthetic appeal and robust functionality.

🧭 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a basic yet functional travel website that mimics real-world platforms like MakeMyTrip or TripAdvisor at a foundational level. Users can browse tour packages, view destination details, fill out inquiry or contact forms, and submit bookings—all while the backend processes and stores the data securely in a MySQL database.
